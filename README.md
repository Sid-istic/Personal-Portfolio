# 🧑‍💻 Siddharth Pratap Singh – Personal Portfolio

Built a sleek and dynamic personal portfolio in just **1 day** 😤 to showcase my AI projects, skills, and journey.

This site isn’t just a static resume — it’s powered by Flask on the backend, and includes a Gemini-powered **LLM assistant** trained on my structured profile data. Think of it as my **virtual avatar** — ask it anything about me!
